# Beginners Roadmap to BugBounty Hunting

Greetings! I'm **Lalatendu Swain**, a Security Engineer and part-time content creator. I've initiated this repository to provide guidance to aspiring bug bounty hunters. Content will be continually added, so stay tuned and let's embark on this journey together!

***Please Note:*** Bug bounty landscapes have evolved significantly in recent years. The vulnerabilities that were once easily discovered may now pose greater challenges due to increased automation and competition. To succeed in bug bounty hunting, persistence and focus are key.

# Getting Started

 - **Understanding Bugs**
	 - A security bug or vulnerability refers to a flaw in software or hardware that, when exploited, compromises confidentiality, integrity, or availability.
 - **Exploring Bug Bounties**
	 - Bug bounty programs offer rewards for discovering and reporting bugs in software products, fostering improvement and user engagement. Rewards vary based on severity and may include monetary compensation, subscriptions, discounts, or swag items.

### Additional Tips
1. Start bug bounty hunting as a part-time endeavor initially, maintaining multiple income streams for stability.
2. Stay updated by following relevant resources and engaging with the cybersecurity community.
3. View bug bounty hunting as a means to enhance skills rather than solely for monetary gain.
4. Develop unique methodologies and avoid over-reliance on automation tools.
5. Consider the severity and context of a vulnerability when assessing its impact.
6. Network with peers and share knowledge within the community.
7. Be proactive and supportive within the bug bounty community.
